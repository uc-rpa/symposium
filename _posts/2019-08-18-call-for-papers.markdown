# Call for abstracts

The Riverside Postdoctoral Association (RPA) would like to invite all postdoc community members to actively participate in the upcoming UCR Postdoc Symposium. The event will take place on November 4th, 2019 at the HUB building on the UCR Campus in Riverside, CA.

# **Communicate, Explore, Collaborate, Invent**
The Postdoc symposium is a great opportunity for professional development and networking within the UC Riverside community. The goals of this event are for you to:

* Communicate your research
* Explore the diversity of postdoctoral research performed at UCR
* Collaborate with other postdocs
* Invent a world-changing idea 

This day is designed to increase the visibility of Postdoc Research at UCR. The event will focus on the diversity of our community and contribution to the research excellence at UCR. It will be a great way for you to discover new fields of research, connect with future collaborators in other departments, increase your network in the research community, and stimulate innovative thinking. The symposium provides a unique opportunity to get more out of your UCR experience than spending days and nights in the lab, field, or office.

## Eligibility and Selection
Only UCR and affiliated postdoctoral scholars (with title code 3252, 3253, or 3254) are eligible to present at the postdoc symposium. The abstract submission form (talk and/or poster) can be accessed from [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfOe5ACmnpw3ser3Nx0gstof-4_G7gwnhCwgG0CNB4ttNWYBw/viewform).

## Timeline

* Fri, Sep 20: Abstract submission deadline for speaker and poster presentation.
* Mon, Oct 14: Selected speakers and posters will be notified.
* Tue, Oct 1: Registration Opens (No registration fee and free lunch for Postdocs)
* Mon, Nov 4: Symposium

## Guidelines for Abstract

* For talks and posters, abstracts should be 250 words or less.
* Talks and posters will be selected for the symposium based on 
    - the interest of the research to a wide audience
    - clarity of the abstract
* Please submit an abstract that is understandable to the general research community.
* Avoid using highly technical language, abbreviations, and jargon specific to your field.
* Describe the objectives, results, and implications of your research in the abstract. 
* Do not include illustrations with the abstract.
* Abstracts will not be edited for content. Be sure to double-check your abstract for typographical or grammatical errors before submitting it. Please avoid entering special characters and symbols.
* Abstracts will be reviewed by a Scientific Committee from UCR. We will do our best to accept as many abstracts as possible, within the constraint of prioritizing representation across different disciplines.

## Guidelines for Short Talks
* Short talks are 12-minute Ted-Style presentations intended to promote interdisciplinary research and spark discussions among symposium participants. These talks are a way to quickly present your current work to a general audience. An important benefit of giving a talk is the opportunity to get personalized, positive feedback as you meet people throughout the day and to find potential collaborators in other departments. 
* The talks are 10 minutes in length with 2 minutes for questions (12 minutes total).
* Your talk should be understandable and interesting to the general academic audience.
* Best talk will be awarded.
cThe non-selected talks will be invited to submit a poster.

## Guidelines for Posters 
* Presenting a poster is a great way to exchange ideas and meaningful discussion. The poster session offers an opportunity to display materials and engage in open-ended, individualized, and informal discussions with interested parties.
* Prepare the poster for a general audience and posters will be judged according to clarity and interest. 
* Best poster will be awarded. 

**Note**: We would like to remind you that this event is public disclosure from the perspective of any patentable technologies. Records of the invention should be filed with the tech transfer before public disclosure.
